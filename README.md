My Reads (for udacity)
======================

# About the program

Main Page
-------------------
The main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories),
each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book.
When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.
The default value for the control is the current shelf the book is in.

Search Page
-------------------
The search page has a text input that may be used to find books.
As the value of the text input changes,
the books that match that query are displayed on the page,
along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
